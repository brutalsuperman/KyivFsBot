Manual installation
-----------------------------------
* register you own telegramm bot via https://telegram.me/botfather and save Token for future use (API_TOKEN)
* download the sources
* copy config.sample.py -> config.py
* edit config.py
** fill API_TOKEN - value, obtained from BotFather
** fill ADMINS - telegram nicks of users, that can manage bot
** fill MODES - what screens you bot will count (Trekker/Builder/Purifier is default. Change if you wish)
** fill WELCOME - new users will see it, on conversation start
* start you bot by "docker-compose up -d" (it will take nearly 10 minutes)
* create two telegram chats (Supergroups is better), and add you new bot to them. First group for good screens, and second - for bad screens
* write "/chatid" in them, and detect its ID
* edit your config.py one more time and:
** fill CHAT_OK - id of chat, where bot will forward good screens
** fill CHAT_FAIL - id of chat, where bot will forward bad screens (that it cant to recognize)
* restart bot with "docker-compose restart"
* test you bot with /help or /me command. Or send some screenshots to it
